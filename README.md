# Brio Classic
Brio classic is a simple fork to the old Interface of Brio.

## THIS IS NOT A SUPPORTED VERSION. AND USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK
Reasoning for the fork is that although Asgard, Minmoose and the contributers made a wonderful plugin, with awesome features.
I wanted to use the older version. this is just my silly reason. I do not wish any harm. :3

Please do not use this plugin, instead use the [up-to-date version](https://github.com/Etheirys/Brio). 

Also do not send any bug reports to Brio instead, make an issue here. they are already hard working people :3

## Installation
1. Add the custom Dalamud repo `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marfjeh/Brio_classic/main/repo.json`
2. Enable the `Brio` plugin
3. Run the `/brio` command
